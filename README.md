# Customer Insurance Prediction

Predict whether a customer will purchase insurance based on their age and estimated salary using various machine learning classification models.

---

## üìå Project Overview

As an analyst at a bank-affiliated insurance company, your goal is to develop a predictive AI model using customer demographics (excluding personal identifiers) to identify potential insurance buyers. This helps improve targeting, reduce marketing costs, and boost conversions.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

Develop and compare multiple machine learning classification algorithms to:

- Predict insurance purchase decisions.
- Evaluate model performance across accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Determine the most effective model that balances accuracy and generalization.

---

## üß† ML Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## üìä Dataset

Each record contains:

- `Age`: Customer's age
- `EstimatedSalary`: Annual income
- `Purchased`: 1 if the customer purchased insurance, else 0

*1000 rows of synthetic but realistic data were used for training and testing.*
